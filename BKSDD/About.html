<p1>As a collective, we are Brown Kids Still Daydream. Our mission as B.K.S.D.D. is to educate young adults on the effects of contamination and how it effects their daily lives through an open platform for lower income communities based on personal advocation their communities through our social media and message board and by educating the public on how they can make their lives and situations better. Us as a team are involved in a program called 'SMASH' which inspired us to create this brand based around helping those who have experienced the silent killer of their communities, pollution. We spent 5 weeks collectively learning and understanding the issue of contamination and focusing our solution on how we can educate lower income communities on the issue of contamination because based on our beginning research, we learned that most people don't truly understand the problem with contamination and the effects it can have on a communities when the different factors of the problem begin to really stack up. </p1>
