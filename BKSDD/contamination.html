<h3 style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">What Is SO2?</h3>
<p1>SO2, or Sulpher Dioxide is a gas. It is invisible and has a nasty, sharp smell. It reacts easily with other substances to form harmful compounds, such as sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid and sulfate particles. About 99% of the sulfur dioxide in air comes from human sources.</p1>

<h3 style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">Why SO2?</h3>
<p1>We chose to focus on SO2 because it's an air pollutant that is averaged at 1.2% in Michigan. It is consistent and when combined with the idea of environmental racism, we can assume that this problem is happening at disproportionate rates to lower income communities when compared to their white counterparts. </p1>
